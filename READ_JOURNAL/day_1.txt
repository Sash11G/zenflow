Day 1:
Today I feel better already, I had better sleep. I went to the sauna and i did
some vibrating movements with my body, I tighten up the torso and move my arms
in a running motion, very quickly, and it feels like a release.
Then I did bicep curls, some static abs with fast side to side motions, and
some triceps. It felt like I flushed asome sweat and I feel refreshed.

I will start doing these kinds of fast burst exercises.
My mind feels clearer, I think thatquitting the Shiterba Mierdate is a great idea
and I believe that it is one of the main culprits of my suboptimal state.
