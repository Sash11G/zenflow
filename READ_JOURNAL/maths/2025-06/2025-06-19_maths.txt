Log for maths on 2025-06-19


Days per chapter:
Chapter 1: 24 days
Chapter 3: 


Book: Trigonometry
By: Lial, Hornsby, Schneider, Daniels

Cleared Chapter 1 "Trigonometric Functions"

Finished chapter 1, I learned about similar triangles, angles, supplementary and complementary
angles proportions of vertical angles, coterminal angles, trig functions, trig func identities, 
recirocal id'sstandard angles, quadrant angles, pythagorean distance formula, signs and 
ranges of functions pythagorean id's.


Now I will move to chapter 3, skip 2 for now. This was suggested by the AI in regards to computer graphics knowledge.

The trig book arrived 26 May, and now its 19 June. It took 24 days to clear the first chapter, and I didnt work
too diligently.

Today I did work for some hours, and I also played a ton of fortnite, which is wasted time.
If I invest my time correctly I can advance much faster.

For now I have figured that I will do 30 min Fortnite sessions every 4 hours, I think the bouts may leave me wanting 
reward, and I thnk maths could fill in that gap.

I have to invest time in chunks. But be constantly moving forwards.
