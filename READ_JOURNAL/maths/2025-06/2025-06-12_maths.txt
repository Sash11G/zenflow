Log for maths on 2025-06-12

I have to keep up the good work.
Every day doing maths...
I have been procrastinating a bit. 

I just have to study at a comfortable pace.

Stop doing things that are irrelevant, focus
on doing things that pack a good punch, like:
- Trig, precalc, and calc books.
- Python projects, relevant useful projects for life.
- C projects, exploring C potential and usage, low level.
- Cisco Networking path.
- OS dev.
- Graphics.

Some of these build over the others, so focus on progressively
building knowledge.

Focus on learning structurally with books that are in the 
goldilocks zone, comfortably challenging/hard.

Good textbooks are best learning resources.
