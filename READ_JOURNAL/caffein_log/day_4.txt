Day 4:

I awoke early yesterday, then napped, the day was nice, I went to the shopping center and did maths at a cafe.

Today, Saturday, I plan to take it easy, it's my "Sabbath" day, I like the idea of Saturday being the holy day.
I prefer it this way because Sunday, being the day previous to the "official start of the week", i think is an
advantageous day to start moving the gears for the week, 1 day ahead of everyone else.

Becuase Sunday is an active day, and I believe having 2 consecutive days of ease a week is fine, Friday (Viernes),
is the other one.

In the myth of Abrahamic religions, God created the world in 6 days and rested in the 7th day.
That seventh day is Saturday, last day of the week, only day of the week in english still romanized.
Saturday represents Saturn, Kronos, the first God, here's a brief description of him:

Saturday is named after Saturn, the Roman god of time, harvest, and abundance. He ruled during a mythical 
Golden Age of peace, prosperity, and equality. Associated with discipline, boundaries, and cycles, Saturn
also has a darker sideâ€”linked to Cronos, who devoured his children to avoid losing power. This dark act
symbolizes fear of change, loss of power, and the destructive side of time. Saturn represents the balance
between order and decay, reminding us that through limitation comes growth, and that endings make way for renewal.
