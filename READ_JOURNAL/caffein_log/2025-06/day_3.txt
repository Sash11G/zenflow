May 29 - Thursday

Day 4:

Yesterday I drank beer+sprite, not too much but I regret it,
because I woke up feeling suboptimal. I felt good, just not optimal.

When I awoke I visualized my past: some factual, some edited.
My breathing was quite open and deep and refreshing. I felt very centered and clear headed,
the caffein side effects are noticeably fading.

In my clarity and deep breathed peace, I visualized what my first daily tasks should be.
I saw myself doing laundry, turning on the sauna and going for a walk, while recalling yesterday's study.

Habit: Stop, Visualize next few steps and execute.

MOST importantly, while breathing in the morning, laying on my back I felt:
- Peace, bliss, and 'good laziness'.
- That I must waste less energy, but direct it better.
- That I make things difficult, when they are easy.
- Just constant, relaxed, easy, flowing, pleasure, bliss, non-doing.
- Easy pace, blissful walk, step by step, you will walk the myriad steps.
- Life's a process, the body is a process. Be the process, flow, transform the world by
  doing nothing. Seamlessly go from birth to death. Empty, hollow, void, satori.

Study: 
- Doing a moderate amount constantly, daily, is best.
- Have a rough long term goals.
- Have clear daily goals. 
  Doable chunks. 
  If you can do a bit more, do so.
  Never push yoursef, and don't hold back. 
  Effortless doing, non-doing, (Wu Wei).

End of Day, Reflect:
- On your day.
- On your long term path.
- On your next day.
- On day of week, month, year.
- On your life process.
- On your core way of life (Taoism, and it's ways of being).
- On the people around you.
