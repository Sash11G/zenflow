I feel groggy, my mind is cloudy, i dont sleep well at night, and i feel dehydrated.
This is because of the yerba mate, or rather: shiterba mierdate.
It is addictive, probably with laced chemicals to shit up your brain.
Preferable is to drink coffee.

I will diminish the dosage of shiterba mierdate, until I ditch it completely.
