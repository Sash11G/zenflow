May 27 - Tuesday


Day 2:
Today I awoke... It's a rainy day, I'm sitting with the thinkpad 
on top of the keyboard hand rest, and fortnite on the screen.

Yesterday I bought a lot of tea/herbs, like tilo, passiflora, and others..
I am mixing them with yerba mate, to reduce my intake and eliminate caffein from my diet.

I am feeling quite clear headed today, I think I'm already seeing benefits.

This is good, because by having more mental energy and clarity I will have the capacity
to study progressively and comfortably day by day. Learning and absorbing knowledge like:
Maths, C languge syntax, DSA, libs, projects; OS, com arch, and more.

It's a matter of making it part of your lifestyle, you dont study maths or C programming or
OS's and so on, it is something you comfortably do evryday, just for the joy it brings,
and like that you naturally and effortlessly absorb and learn it.

End.
