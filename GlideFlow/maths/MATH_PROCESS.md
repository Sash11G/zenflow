# Math Mastery Guide

A focused method for mastering mathematics through a three-step loop:

---

## ① Understand

- The *only* thorough way: **proofs**  
- **Why?**  
  - They **explain why** something is true  
  - They reveal the **logic and structure** behind rules, theorems, and definitions  
  - Tracking proofs builds **mathematical intuition**  
  - You learn to **think like math does**

---

## ② Internalize

- Internalize **properties and rules**  
- Proofs naturally lead you to:
  - Discover and accept key **properties**  
  - Understand **operations** (commutative, associative, etc.)
- These become **mental tools** for solving problems

---

## ③ Apply

- **Apply in exercises**  
- Application shows you how **theory manifests in practice**
- Reinforces memory and trains **pattern recognition**
- You begin to **create your own mini-proofs**
