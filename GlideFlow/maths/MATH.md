## CURRENT EDGE

- [ ] Subject: Mathematics
- [ ] Trigonometry Textbook
- [ ] Focus: Limits, coordinate geometry, Gaussian elimination
- [ ] Next Step: Solve mixed problems using concept combinations (e.g., matrix + line equations)
- [ ] Blocked By: Fully internalizing how limits and transformations behave geometrically

## MATH TRACK

### Active Topics
- Limits (in progress)
- Algebra 2: polynomials, quadratics, rational expressions
- Coordinate geometry: lines, slope, distance, midpoint, circle equation
- Matrix operations: addition, multiplication, Gaussian elimination
- Solving systems of equations (algebraically and via matrices)

### Key Principles
- Math builds upward — don’t skip foundations.
- Avoid bad habits: understand before repeating.
- Every formula must be visualized and explained.
- Train fluid intelligence: solve, explain, switch methods.

### Daily Flow (30–45 min)
- **Recall 3 concepts from memory**
- **Deep drill**: 1 concept, 3 problems, increasing depth
- **Mixed review**: 4–5 varied short problems
- **Reflect**: What clicked? What needs work?

### Weekly Flow
- 1 Concept review session
- 1 Timed practice (10 mixed problems, 30 mins)
- 1 Reflection log: “What I Know Now”
