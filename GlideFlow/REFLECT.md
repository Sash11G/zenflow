### 🔍 Step 1: Identify Your Current Level

* ✅ = Confident
* 🔸 = Somewhat know
* ❌ = Don’t know yet

| Topic                                                | Status |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| C language: syntax, pointers, memory management      |        |
| C: socket programming, file I/O, structs             |        |
| Linux: shell scripting, permissions, processes       |        |
| Operating systems: memory, scheduling, boot process  |        |
| Python: OOP, data structures, scripting              |        |
| Networking: TCP/IP, ports, protocols                 |        |
| Web: HTTP, Django basics, backend logic              |        |
| Algorithms: NeetCode patterns, recursion, DSA        |        |
| Math: algebra, matrices, transformations             |        |
| Graphics: Pygame/OpenGL, rendering basics            |        |
| Security: ethical hacking, Kali tools, threat models |        |

### 🔭 Step 2: Define Your “Tip of the Spear”

Let’s say you want to push the limits in:

* **C programming:** master OS-level tasks (e.g., write a shell, a process manager).
* **Graphics:** go from matrix transforms to building a simple OpenGL engine.
* **Web/backend:** take a Django project live with security, login, file uploads.
* **Math:** reach full comfort with linear algebra, then dip into discrete math.

Pick 1–2 and mark the rest as “on hold but mapped.”

### 🧱 Step 3: Build from Where You Are

For each area you're working on, answer:

* What’s the last thing I fully understood and implemented?
* What’s the next exciting thing that scares me just enough?

Then set a mini-project or a question to guide the next session.

### 🗺️ Step 4: Track Progress Visually

Make a **living document or whiteboard** with:

* What you know
* What you’re building
* What’s next
* What feels fuzzy or incomplete

This gives you **direction at all times**, avoiding wasted loops.
