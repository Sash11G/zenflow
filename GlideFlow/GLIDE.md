- **Move as water does — without force, yet through all things.**
- **Let action emerge like breath — natural, unnoticed, complete.**
- **True skill leaves no trace — only harmony remains.**
- **Effort fades when the way is found.**
- **The hand does not cut — it flows where the cut already is.**  
- **In still practice, motion becomes effortless.**

## CURRENT EDGE

- [ ] ☐ Area: **C Programming**
- [ ] ☐ Specific: Master `malloc` + `free` use in a small project
- [ ] ☐ Blocked by: Not fully understanding pointer arithmetic
- [ ] ☐ Next step: Build dynamic array from scratch

## ACTIVE CYCLES

### 1. Operating Systems
- [x] Processes and threads — reviewed
- [ ] Memory management — read paging, still fuzzy on page tables
- [ ] Next: Implement a memory simulator in C

### 2. Socket Programming
- [x] TCP client/server connection tested
- [ ] File transfer: need to fix destination path logic
- [ ] Next: Add file type categorization (by MIME or ext)

### 3. Math
- [ ] Trig review: Unit circle, sin/cos relations
- [ ] Linear algebra: Matrix transforms for OpenGL
- [ ] Next: Rotate 2D triangle around center in C

## TO DO REFINEMENTS

- [ ] Clean up `.zshrc` and load reminders async
- [ ] Add timestamps to `glidecut` items
- [ ] Write weekly reflection script

| Date       | Motion / Insight                                |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 2025-06-17 | Rewrote reminder script, removed sed bug        |
| 2025-06-17 | Understood why zshrc reminder load is delayed   |
| 2025-06-16 | Realized "arc" and "archē" are conceptually linked |

## PRINCIPLE

Flow over force. Mastery comes through elegant repetition.
