Perfect. Since you already know matrix operations, you're ready to focus on:

### ðŸ”‘ Topics to Study Next (3D Graphics-Focused):

1. **Rotation matrices** in 3D (X, Y, Z axes)
    
2. **World / view / projection matrix pipeline**
    
3. **Homogeneous coordinates** and why we use 4Ã—4 matrices
    
4. **Perspective division** and depth (`1/z` scaling)
    
5. **Transform hierarchy**: model â†’ world â†’ view â†’ clip space
    
6. **Camera transformation** (view matrix = inverse of camera pose)
    
7. **Normal vectors** and rotation without translation
    
8. **Cross products** (for computing perpendicular vectors and basis)
